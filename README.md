# Rick and Morty the app, now on SwiftUI ðŸ¥³

![Rick and Morty](rick-and-morty.gif)

# What you will find up there? 

- This is a completely rewritten project on SwiftUI

# What for?

- If you are Rick and Morty's fan, this app also will upgrade knowledge about characters you couldn't known or heard about them.
- To improve my own knowledge of language which I'm using, and to show how do I use it.

# What's in?
- This app comes with some integration tests (and will be advanced in more time)
- I'm trying my best to avoid any #CocoaPods in this implementation, just to use solutions out of the box


# Architectures used in :
- MVVM
- Coordinator
- Dependency Injection

# Done
- [x] Choose and add an app icon just to make the home screen look nicer
- [x] Add characters and their description
- [x] Add locations based form each character
- [x] Add each episode description
- [x] Add Pagination with pages loading while scrolling
- [x] Extend test coverage
- [x] Add posibility to choose list type 


# TODO
- [ ] Add an abstract login/logout feature to collect favorite locations/characters/episodes in one place
- [ ] Add animations, basic UI to make app more colorful and attractive
